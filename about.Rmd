### *Under Construction*

I love outdoor activities, traveling and aviation. My favourite destinations were Portugal, Montenegro and Thailand.

In my free time, I also manage an airline company in the game Airlines Manager. Currently, my airline is operating ~792 aircraft (including 101 cargo planes), flying to ~381 destinations. I have ~520,311 staff, working at 10 hubs: HKG, TPE, NRT, BKK, DXB, FRA, MAD, ANC, LAX and JFK.
