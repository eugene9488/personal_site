### *Acquisition of gendered speech*
Advisor: Benjamin Munson, University of Minnesota

It has been long hypothesized that the speech of children assigned male at birth (AMAB) and children female at birth (AFAB) should not differ before puberty, because sex dimorphism  (i.e., differences between cisgender adult men and women) in the vocal organs occurs at puberty. Nevertheless, previous literature showed that adults are able to distinguish voices between AMAB and AFAB children well-above chance. It follows that any differences between the speech of these groups of children are "performed" and "socially learned". It remains unclear what phonetic features distinguish AMAB children from AFAB children, and how children acquire such gender-related features of speech. 


In the current project, we conduct acoustical analysis on the speech of 55 AMAB and 55 AFAB children at 2.5 and 5 years-of-age in a longitudinal study by Munson & Edwards. Specifically, we look at how F0, acoustic vocal tract length, vowel space size and /s/ acoustics contributes to the perceived gender ratings of these children.


In the future, we would like to conduct cross-linguistic studies and behavioral studies examining how children acquire these variation of speech.

Preliminary results of this study was presented in the ASA Fall 2021 meeting in Seattle.

### *Voice Quality features of Hong Kong Cantonese and Guangzhou Cantonese*
Collaborator: Roxana Fung, HKPolyU

Hong Kong Cantonese (HKC) and Guangzhou Cantonese (GZC) are two regional accents of Cantonese. They share the same phonetic inventory except for the high-level tone (55) could be realized as a high-falling tone (53) in older GZC talkers. However, native speakers can often distinguish the two accents without the cue of the high-falling tone. It remains a perplexing question on what are the phonetic distinction between the two Cantonese accents. 

### Part 1
In this study, we aim to look at the voice quality features of the two accents, and the development of these features between the three age groups. We examined the speech of 191 Cantonese talkers of three age groups from the two cities. We measured the auditory and acoustic analysis of the voice quality features. 

Preliminary results of this study was presented in:

Fung, R. and Wong, Y-C. (2017). The voice quality differences between Hong Kong Cantonese and Guangzhou Cantonese. The 22nd JWLLP & The 5th Workshop on VariAMU. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, April 8th, 2017.

### Part 2
In the second part of this project, we want to further investigate the voice quality settings of HKC and GZC. Specifically, we look at differences in laryngeal settings, tongue posture and resonance. We collected acoustic and EGG data of 20 HKC and 20 GZC talkers performing text-reading and free speech tasks. Data Analysis is on-going.
