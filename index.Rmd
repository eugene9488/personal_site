**Hi!** I am Eugene, a second year PhD student in [**Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences at the University of Minnesota**](https://cla.umn.edu/slhs). I am also a proud Hongkonger, born and raised in Hong Kong and a native speaker of Cantonese. 



My main research interests are in sociophonetics and speech production. I am interested in how children acquire socially meaningful variation of speech, and how adults use voice quality features to express their social identities. 


Before coming to the University of Minnesota, I worked as a lab manager in the [**Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University**](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/).
