**Hi!** I am Eugene, a fifth year PhD student in [**Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences at the University of Minnesota**](https://cla.umn.edu/slhs). I am also a Hongkonger, born and raised in Hong Kong and a native speaker of Cantonese. 



My main research interests are in sociophonetics: I am interested in how children acquire socially meaningful variations of speech. I also work on improving language assessment methods for bilingual children. You can learn more about my research [here](https://eugene9488.github.io/personal_site/research.html).


Before coming to the University of Minnesota, I worked as a lab manager in the [**Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University**](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/).
