## <span style="color:#464646;">**Hi!**</span>

<span style="color:#464646;">
I am Eugene, a second year PhD student in [**Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences at the University of Minnesota**](https://cla.umn.edu/slhs). I am also a proud Hongkonger, born and raised in Hong Kong and a native speaker of Cantonese. 
</span>

<span style="color:#464646;">
My main research interests are in sociophonetics and speech production. I am interested in how children acquire gendered speech, and how people use voice quality features to express their social identities. 
</span>

<span style="color:#464646;">
Before coming to the University of Minnesota, I worked as a lab manager in the [**Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University**](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/).
